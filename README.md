# happiness-score_statistical-analysis
This repository is for Econometrics Project. The topic of the project is Happines Score.

What factors affect happiness the most? How does GDP per capita affect happiness in a country? We explore these questions by using data from the World Happiness Report, taking log of GDP per capita as variable of interest, and running regression models to see which model would be the best fit for our topic.
